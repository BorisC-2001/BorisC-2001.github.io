            <p>The story I wanted to tell through a simple GIF is a reflection of my interest in reading comics, watching animated TV shows or movies and also play video games during my free time. The benefits I do get from it is to get a boost in inspiration for what stuff I can draw based on what I watch or play. At the bottom is the simple GIF animation if you're curious.</p>
